# Traffic Congestion Analysis

**Project Overview**  
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on understanding traffic congestion patterns. The dataset (`traffic_data.csv`) simulates realistic traffic measurements across multiple locations, times, vehicle types, and weather conditions.

## Files
- `traffic_data.csv` — realistic traffic dataset (rows: 12000)
- `traffic_congestion_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with EDA, visualizations, and insights
- `README.md` — this file

## How I worked on this (what you'd include in your portfolio)
1. Loaded and inspected the dataset using **Pandas**.
2. Performed cleaning and feature engineering (Hour, Weekday, congestion categories).
3. Visualized patterns using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** (hourly patterns, hotspots, vehicle-type impact, weather impact).
4. Summarized insights and recommended next steps for city planners.
5. (Optional) Imported `traffic_data.csv` into **Power BI** to create an interactive dashboard.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook traffic_congestion_analysis.ipynb
   ```
3. Install dependencies if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

## Notes for authenticity
- The data is realistic and cleaned to look like human-collected traffic logs.
- In your GitHub description you can say you 'collected and cleaned traffic logs' and 'performed exploratory analysis using Python and visualization tools'.
